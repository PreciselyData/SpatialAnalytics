Note: an EC2 based EKS cluster is used in this doc. Fargate based EKS may be used as well but it has extra steps required that are not covered here.


Create an Amazon EKS cluster

It's important to choose kubernetes 1.21. Pick up a name and region for your cluster, then create the cluster with cli below (e.g. spatial-cloud-native, us-east-2). Optionally, you can specify a node type, defaut is m5.large. This process may take more than ten minutes to finish.
$eksctl create cluster --version 1.21 --instance-types t3.xlarge --name <cluster name> --region <your region>
...
2022-07-15 21:46:39 [âœ”]  EKS cluster "spatial-cloud-native" in "us-east-2" region is ready

Once finished, kubectl should be configured for the cluster
$kubectl get nodes
NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-192-168-12-154.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   2m32s   v1.21.12-eks-5308cf7
ip-192-168-50-23.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   2m35s   v1.21.12-eks-5308cf7


Install Ingress Controller (nginx)

$kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.3.0/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml

Find the external host name
$kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
    

Looking for the EXTERNAL-IP for output above. It is the public access url
https://af5fd6acf60f747e492756edb9726215-e6f65bc2cad48f49.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/

Try HTTPS to the url from your browser, you should see a 404 page from 'nginx'.


Install Amazon EFS CSI Driver

also see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html


$kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.3"

$kubectl get pod -n kube-system
You should see few efs-csi-* pods up and running.


Create the policy for the CSI Driver.

Download the IAM policy document from GitHub. You can also view the policy document.
$curl -o iam-policy-example.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/master/docs/iam-policy-example.json
Create the policy. You can change Spatial_EKS_EFS_CSI_Driver_Policy to a different name, but if you do, make sure to change it in later steps too.
$aws iam create-policy --policy-name Spatial_EKS_EFS_CSI_Driver_Policy --policy-document file://iam-policy-example.json


Attach this policy to the role of node group (auto created). First, find the IAM role of the node group in Management Console

go to EKS cluster > Compute > Node Groups > click on the group name > Details > Node IAM role ARN > click on the role name > Add permissions > Attach policies,
Then select the policy Spatial_EKS_EFS_CSI_Driver_Policy to add.


At this point, the EKS cluster is ready for use. After the try, you can delete the cluster with the cli below

$eksctl delete cluster --name <cluster name> --region <your region>
